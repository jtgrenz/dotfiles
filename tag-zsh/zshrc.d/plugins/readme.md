Custom plugins are added here. Third-party plugins are installed by adding the github repo to the `./antibody/plugins` and running `antibody static`. For first party plugins, you can add them to this directory and zsh will autoload all files in this directory. Generally, the plugin files should not be added here in the dot files, but added to `tag-TAGNAME/PLUGIN_DIR` in the dotfiles directory. `rcm`'s `rcup` command will link the `tag-TAGNAME/zshrc.d/plugins/PLUGIN_DIR` file to the copied `zshrc.d/plugins/` directory.
